# Unsupervised Learning in Machine Learning Algorithms
In this section, we will examine unsupervised learning algorithms in machine learning.

<hr />

1. K-Means

  ðŸ“Œ The aim is to categorize the observations according to their similarity to each other.

2. Hierarchical Clustering

  ðŸ“Œ The aim is to divide the observations into subsets according to their similarity to each other.

3. Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

  ðŸ“Œ The aim is to represent the main features of multivariate data with fewer variables. In other words, it is to reduce the variable size by risking a small amount of information loss.
